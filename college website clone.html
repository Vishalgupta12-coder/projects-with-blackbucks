          The Lyallpur Khalsa College of Engineering got established in 2013
          under the aegis of Khalsa College Lyallpur Education Charitable Trust.
          The Institute is located in the heart of city on a prime piece of
          land. It was established with an aim to impart engineering education
          to the students to make them competent, motivated engineers and
          scientists. The institute as a first step will provide the education
          in the field of Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electronics
          & Communication Engineering and Computer Science & Engineering
          disciplines, the most sought after disciplines at present due to the

          fields and very rapid investments taking place in the region. The
          Institute not only celebrates freedom of thought, cultivates vision
          and encourages growth, but also inculcates human values and concern
          for the environment and the society.
